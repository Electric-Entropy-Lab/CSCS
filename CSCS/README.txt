# CSCS — Cognitive State Control System (Lite)

Experimental browser extension for local observation of interaction patterns
during knowledge work.

CSCS was built as a **personal research tool** to explore cognitive load,
behavioral rhythm, and execution stability based on **non-semantic interaction signals**.

This is **not** a commercial product.

---

## What it does

CSCS observes **how** you interact with the system — not **what** you write or view.

It operates on signals such as:
- keyboard timing and correction patterns
- interaction rhythm and pauses
- mouse movement dynamics
- focus / blur events
- temporal aggregates and heuristics

All processing happens **locally**.

There is:
- no text analysis
- no semantic interpretation
- no remote communication
- no analytics
- no cloud

---

## What it is not

- Not a productivity tool  
- Not a medical or psychological system  
- Not a diagnostic instrument  
- Not a polished consumer extension  

If you are looking for a ready-made product, this is probably not for you.

## Data & privacy

- No data is transmitted anywhere
- No servers are involved
- No accounts, tracking, or telemetry
- Data is stored locally (IndexedDB or user-selected filesystem)
- Export is fully manual

If you don’t trust that, read the code.

## Status

- Built for personal use
- Actively used by the author
- No roadmap
- No guarantees
- No support

This repository is published for **research transparency and reference**.

## Intended audience

People who:
- work deeply with systems, UX, or cognition
- understand interaction-level signals
- prefer tools that expose process rather than hide it
- are comfortable reading source code

If you don’t immediately see why this might be useful — it probably isn’t for you.
